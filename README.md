# Filter-Extension-Principle

This repository provides the formalization of the Filter Extension Principle (FEP).

The dependency order of these files is:  mk_structure.v  -->  mk_theorems.v  -->  alge_operation.v  -->  infinite_set.v  -->  filter.v  -->  filter_extension.v

mk_structure.v and mk_theorems.v describe the formalization of Morse-Kelley axiomatic set theory.

alge_operation.v includes the addition and multiplication on Ï‰.

infinite_set.v verifies some properties about infinite sets.

filter.v is the formalization of concepts of filters, maximal filters, ultrafilters, principal ultrafilters, non-principal ultrafilters and free ultrafilters, along with some their properties.

filter_extension.v verifies the Filter Extension Principle.
